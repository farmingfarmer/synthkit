# synthkit — working conventions

Synthetic clinical data generator and model-evaluation instrument. Core rule: learn the patterns, never copy the records. Real data teaches parameters; generation never touches a record.

## Verify before claiming

- Run `python scripts/run_all_smokes.py` before saying anything works. Expect 46 suites, 1250 checks, ALL GREEN.
- `py_compile` every Python file you touch.
- Assert count==1 before every string replacement — verify the edit, not just the compile.
- **Read a file before Write overwrites it.** `Write` says "updated"
  rather than "created" when the path exists, and that word is the
  only warning. A new `synthkit/spec.py` silently replaced SYNTH_V1's
  DataSpec and took out 17 suites. `ls` the target, or pick a name the
  repo does not already use.
- Never state a number as measured unless you actually ran it.

## Fixing what the real extract found

The Windows machine has the data; this machine has only its statistics.
Every rule here exists because a fix passed here and did nothing, or
did harm, there.

- **Make the fixture reproduce the fault BEFORE fixing it, and assert
  that it does.** A guard verified only against a shape invented here
  will pass while failing on the shape that exists. A string `visit_id`
  passed; the real one is an integer and the guard never fired.
- **Derive the fixture's key property from a measured statistic, and
  say which one.** Do not assume it. Fix 3a v1 was tested against
  independent missingness and shipped against clustered missingness,
  which no clinical column has — it repaired steadiness and thinned a
  49% missing column to 22%.
- **When a fix changes one property, assert the neighbouring property
  in the same test.** Steadiness and missingness were fixed and broken
  in one commit because only one of them was checked.

## What the 800-patient extract said about the new path

Ran 2026-08-10 on run7's tidy file: 55,428 rows, 47 columns, 800
patients. 274s with `--lags` (73 columns). I had predicted one to
three hours — wrong by roughly 30x, and predicted upward, which is the
direction that stops work happening.

- coverage within 0.05 on 45/45 columns, clustering within 0.15 on
  18/18, persistence within 0.15 on 28/34
- **centre within 10% of spread on only 18/34 numeric columns** — the
  open fidelity gap, not yet diagnosed
- 16 of 26 relationships dropped to keep the graph sampleable, which
  is not yet reported per-edge anywhere a reader would look
- the identifier-derivative fix fired on real data: `visit_id` and its
  lag both dropped

## What the blueprint may publish

- **k counts PATIENTS, never rows.** One person seen 200 times can
  supply the ten most extreme rows alone; a row-counted rule would let
  them set the published bound and still call it anonymous.
- **No published number may be an individual's value.** The stored
  minimum and maximum are the MEAN of the k most extreme patients'
  own extremes. Storing the true 0th/100th percentile published one
  person's smallest and one person's largest value, and did so for
  weeks in a file described as aggregates-only.
- k-anonymity on what is published is NOT differential privacy, and
  the effect curves, interaction surfaces and dynamics have NOT been
  audited the same way. No membership-inference test has been run
  against the new path. Say all of that whenever the posture comes up.

## Numbers before conclusions

- **Recall on the fixture varies 71%-86% across seeds with nothing
  changed but the seed.** A single-seed comparison cannot detect any
  improvement smaller than 15 points, which is one relationship out of
  seven - the size of effect these changes actually produce. Use
  `scripts/recall_sweep.py` and report the range, never a point.

- **Do not report a derived quantity until a second, independent
  measurement agrees with it.** A pooled correlation across columns of
  different scales measured which column a pair came from. A naive
  between-patient share read 0.754 where the truth was 0.500. Both were
  reported, reasoned from, and withdrawn.
- **A statistic fed back as a generative parameter is attenuated
  twice.** Within-patient lag-1 measured by centring on each patient's
  own mean read 0.453 where the truth was 0.700; generating with 0.453
  and re-measuring gave 0.0, and the property vanished while every
  neighbouring check passed. Derive the parameter from an unbiased
  identity, then confirm the output measures back what went in.
- **A flag that is read but not used is worse than no flag.**
  `--time-col` was carried into the blueprint and then ignored when
  the lag features were built — which is what every temporal statistic
  is measured on — so passing it changed nothing and the message still
  named the detected column. Assert the override CHANGED something.
- **A report that lists categories must state a TOTAL the reader can
  check against them.** The dropped-edge section said "2 were mirrors"
  while the run reported 12 dropped: ten had a parent removed to break
  a loop, a category with no section at all, so ten relationships lost
  a parent and nobody was told. An omitted category is invisible in
  any other way.
- **A partial-dependence curve is CONDITIONAL on the other parents,
  and with correlated columns that can flip its sign.** Mean arterial
  pressure is (S + 2D)/3, so holding it fixed, diastolic falls as
  systolic rises. Using that curve to generate diastolic from systolic
  alone produced -0.720 where the source had +0.888. Inverted output
  is worse than absent: it reads as a finding. Every parent also gets
  a curve measured ON ITS OWN, and generation uses that whenever the
  parents it was conditioned on are not all present.
- **A curve and the skill it is paired with must come from the SAME
  model.** The noise added back is sqrt(1 - skill), so a single-parent
  curve carrying the whole claim's skill removes far too much of it:
  systolic against diastolic generated at 0.978 where the source had
  0.888. Each curve now carries the skill of the model that produced
  it.
- **An internal contradiction is the signal.** Every measurement error
  here was caught by two numbers disagreeing, never by review — 0.735
  against an asymptote of 0.38; a negative rho that cannot exist.
- **State predictions as hypotheses with a test, not as findings.**
  Dates driving the attack: −0.001. Bonferroni as the main suppressor:
  +0, twice.

## Talking to the Windows machine

- **That machine is NOT a git repository.** `docs/WINDOWS.md` section
  1 is "Pull the repo (no git needed)": it downloads a zipball,
  extracts it and renames the folder. `git pull`, `git remote`, `git
  status` all fail there with `fatal: not a git repository`. Several
  turns of instructions told the user to `git pull` on it. Read
  WINDOWS.md before writing any command for that machine.
- **It holds real clinical data and this Mac does not.** Anything that
  can be done from either machine should be done from here. Pushing,
  in particular, belongs on the machine with no PHI on it.

- **Code comes from git; output paths are chosen at run time.** Never
  give an invented directory name as if it were a deliverable — say
  plainly that the user picks it. Four round trips were lost to `fix5`,
  `run_missingfix` and `test9` reading as things to pull.
- One command per line, no line wrapping: an unexpanded `%USERPROFILE%`
  wrote real-data output into the repo.
- **That terminal mangles pasted commands.** Three times now: once a
  wrapped paste put `--src` inside the filename, twice a flag never
  reached the program while the log looked normal. Any script that
  runs there must ECHO the settings it received, or a missing flag is
  indistinguishable from a broken fix and costs a round trip.

## Code

- Python 3.8 target for the stdlib engine. No walrus, no match
  statements.
- **numpy, pandas and scikit-learn are allowed** as of 2026-08-07: the
  Windows machine can pip install. `synthkit/discover.py` uses them.
  The older stdlib modules stay stdlib until they are replaced.
- **`getattr(obj, name, default)` on a library attribute is banned.**
  `HistGradientBoosting` has no `feature_importances_`; the getattr
  returned None on every column, the fallback ranked columns by
  POSITION, and recall read 0% while the model scored 0.93 on the same
  target. A silent no-op is worse than a crash. Prefer a screen that
  is the same computation as the measurement, so it cannot no-op.
- Every new capability gets smoke checks that can actually fail. A test that cannot fail proves nothing.
- One CLI command per line, zsh-compatible, BSD `sed -i ''`.

## Environment

- Claude Code runs ONLY on this Mac.
- Real clinical extracts live on a separate Windows machine that pulls from git and runs there. It never runs Claude Code.
- Code that touches real data must be written without access to it: stream, report progress, fail readably.

## Tone

- Direct and concise. No emojis. No over-explanation.
